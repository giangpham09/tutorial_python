# sync_playwright: object in Python is the entry point for synchronously interacting (tương tác đồng bộ) with the Playwright library. It acts as a context manager that initializes the Playwright environment and provides access to the different browser types (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit).
# goto: là 1 method trong class Page, có 2 tham số bắt buộc là self và url
# 2000: millisecond
# headless=False is a configuration setting that forces the browser to open a visible window (also known as "Headed Mode") while your code runs.
